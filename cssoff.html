		<h2>OVERFLOW</h2>
		<p>On the night of <time>Aug 8, 1975</time>, a line of people frantically piled sandbags atop Henan Province's <b>Banqiao Dam</b> while being battered by the worst storm ever recorded in the region. They were in a race with the rapidly rising Ru River to save the dam and the millions of people that lay sleeping downstream. It was a race they were about to lose.</p>
		<p>Just after <time>1:00am</time>, the sky cleared and stars emerged from behind the storm clouds. There was an eerie calm as someone yelled, &ldquo;The water level is going down! The flood is retreating!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>There was little chance to enjoy that calm. One survivor recalled that a few seconds later it &ldquo;sounded like the sky was collapsing and the earth was cracking.&rdquo; The equivalent of 280,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools burst through the crumbling dam, taking with it entire towns and as many as 171,000 lives.</p>
